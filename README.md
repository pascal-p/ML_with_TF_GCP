### C01 - How Google does Machine Learning
 - [x] [How Google does Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

 What is machine learning, and what kinds of problems can it solve? Google thinks about machine learning slightly differently -- of being about logic, rather than just data. We talk about why such a framing is useful for data scientists when thinking about building a pipeline of machine learning models.

Then, we discuss the five phases of converting a candidate use case to be driven by machine learning, and consider why it is important the phases not be skipped. We end with a recognition of the biases that machine learning can amplify and how to recognize this.

### C02 - Launching into Machine Learning
 - [x] [Launching into Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/launching-machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

Starting from a history of machine learning, we discuss why neural networks today perform so well in a variety of data science problems. We then discuss how to set up a supervised learning problem and find a good solution using gradient descent. This involves creating datasets that permit generalization; we talk about methods of doing so in a repeatable way that supports experimentation.

Course Objectives:
  - Identify why deep learning is currently popular
  - Optimize and evaluate models using loss functions and performance metrics
  - Mitigate common problems that arise in machine learning
  - Create repeatable and scalable training, evaluation, and test datasets

### C03 - Introduction to TensorFlow

- [x] [Introduction to TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-tensorflow?specialization=machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

This course is focused on using the flexibility and “ease  of use” of TensorFlow 2.x and Keras to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.  We will learn about the TensorFlow 2.x API hierarchy and will get to know the main components of TensorFlow through hands-on exercises.  We will introduce datasets and feature columns. We will learn how to design and build a TensorFlow 2.x input data pipeline. We will get hands-on practice loading csv data, numPy arrays, text data, and images using tf.Data.Dataset. Finally we will also get hands-on practice creating numeric, categorical, bucketized, and hashed feature columns.

Introduction to Keras Sequential API and the Keras Functional API will be presented on order to define deep learning models. We’ll talk about activation functions, loss, and optimization. Our Jupyter Notebooks hands-on labs offer the opportunity to build basic linear regression, basic logistic regression, and advanced logistic regression machine learning models. We will learn how to train, deploy, and productionalize machine learning models at scale with Cloud AI Platform.

### C05 - Art and Science of Machine Learning

- [x] [Art and Science of Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/art-science-ml?specialization=machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp)

Welcome to the Art and Science of machine learning. This course is delivered in 6 modules. The course covers the essential skills of ML intuition, good judgment and experimentation needed to finely tune and optimize ML models for the best performance. We will learn how to generalize our model using Regularization techniques and about the effects of hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate on model performance.  We’ll cover some of the most common model optimization algorithms and show how to specify an optimization method in our TensorFlow code.

### C06 - End-to-End Machine Learning with TensorFlow on GCP

 - [x] [End-to-End Machine Learning with TensorFlow on GCP](https://www.coursera.org/learn/end-to-end-ml-tensorflow-gcp)

 In the first course of this specialization, we will recap what was covered in the *Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform* Specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp).

One of the best ways to review something is to work with the concepts and technologies that we have learned.
So, this course is set up as a workshop and in this workshop, we will do End-to-End Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform

### C07 - Production Machine Learning Systems
 - [x] [Production Machine Learning Systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-production-ml-systems)

This course covers how to implement the various flavors of production ML systems: static, dynamic, and continuous training; static and dynamic inference; and batch and online processing.
We delve into TensorFlow abstraction levels, the various options for doing distributed training, and how to write distributed training models with custom estimators.

### C08 - Image Understanding with TensorFlow on GCP

 - [x] [Image Understanding with TensorFlow on GCP](https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-understanding-tensorflow-gcp)

This is the third course of the Advanced Machine Learning on GCP specialization.
In this course, We will take a look at different strategies for building an image classifier using convolutional neural networks. We'll improve the model's accuracy with augmentation, feature extraction, and fine-tuning hyperparameters while trying to avoid overfitting our data. We will also look at practical issues that arise, for example, when you don’t have enough data and how to incorporate the latest research findings into our models.
We will get hands-on practice building and optimizing our own image classification models on a variety of public datasets in the labs we’ll work on together.
